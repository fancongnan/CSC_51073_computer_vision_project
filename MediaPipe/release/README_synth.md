This project should run as intended as long as it is in the same directory as the 'toxes' folder.



You may however need to configure the audio plugins. Both audiovst1 and audiovst2 need to call the file 'Helm/helm64.vst3'. 



The synthesizers should also be configured, but if not, you need to follow the following steps :

1. In the audio vst interface click on Display plugin GUI - Show
2. In the GUI, go to BROWSE on the top left corner
3. Choose 'BadEthereal1' preset for audiovst1 and 'PrettySpooky' preset for audiovst2
