The project needs to take a video file as an argument. In the 'video node' choose the file you want to use as a reference. It is expected that the video is the video of a human being.

Be sure to have installed MediaPipe, OpenCV, NumPy, and Other Python Libraries in TouchDesigner as indicated in the first README.
